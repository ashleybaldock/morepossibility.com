          More Possibility is all about creating{' '}
          <Link to={`/tools`}>tools</Link> to enable artists to add light and
          movement to their projects through the use of inexpensive, widely available LED
          modules coupled with an intuitive, powerful, and elegant software interface.

          I also use this system to create my own art â€“ small scale, especially
          through hacking existing lights to add movement and light, and large
          scale installations including the Phenoforge.
