          More Possibility is all about creating{' '}
          <Link to={`/tools`}>tools</Link> to enable artists to add light and
          movement into their projects through the use of cheap, available LED
          modules. Simple, intuitive, elegant software that enables powerful
          expression.

          I also use this system to create my own art â€“ small scale, especially
          through hacking existing lights to add movement and light, and large
          scale installations including the Phenoforge.

          I also offer Software Development and Agile contract services.
